# Home-automation-using-ESP32

I built a Home Automation System using ESP32 and Blynk IoT that enables users to remotely monitor and control home appliances through a smartphone. The ESP32 acts as the central controller, connected to relays and sensors for devices such as lights, fans, and plugs. 

The source code can easily be rewritten as you add more devices by using the existing code as a template. Make sure to mention the pins used are correct in the given source code
